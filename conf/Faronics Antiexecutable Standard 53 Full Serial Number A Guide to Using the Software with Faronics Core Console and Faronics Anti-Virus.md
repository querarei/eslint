How can you prevent malware from compromising your PC? One way is to use an anti-executable software that blocks unauthorized applications from running on your system. Anti-executable software works by creating a whitelist of trusted programs that are allowed to execute, and denying access to any other executable files that are not on the list.
 
One of the best anti-executable software in the market is Faronics Antiexecutable Standard 53. This software is designed to provide comprehensive protection against malware for home users and small businesses.
