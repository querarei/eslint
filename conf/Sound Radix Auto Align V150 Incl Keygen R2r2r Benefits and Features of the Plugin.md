## What is Phase Alignment and Why is it Important?
 
Phase alignment is the process of adjusting the timing of audio signals from different sources so that they are in sync with each other. When audio signals are out of phase, they can interfere with each other and cause destructive frequency cancellations or additions, resulting in a distorted and unclear sound. This phenomenon is known as comb-filtering, because it creates a series of notches and peaks in the frequency spectrum that resemble a comb.
 
Phase alignment is especially important when recording an instrument with more than one microphone or direct input, such as drums, guitar amps, acoustic guitars, piano, etc. If the microphones are not aligned properly, the sound will lose its definition, depth and stereo width. For example, if the kick drum mic and the overhead mic are out of phase, the low frequencies of the kick drum will cancel out with the overhead mic, making the kick drum sound thin and weak.
 
Phase alignment can also affect the overall directionality of the sound source. If the microphones are not aligned with the original sound direction, the reproduced sound will appear to come from a different location than the actual source. This can create a confusing and unnatural listening experience.
 
## How Does Sound Radix Auto-Align V150 Work?
 
Sound Radix Auto-Align V150 is a plugin that automatically aligns the phase of multiple microphones or direct inputs in a single click. It works by detecting a common impulse in the audio signals and applying a precise delay to each signal so that they are perfectly aligned in time. It also corrects any phase shifts that occur within specific frequency ranges using its spectral phase optimization feature. Additionally, it corrects the overall sound directionality using its absolute phase optimization feature.
 
To use Sound Radix Auto-Align V150, you simply insert it on each track that you want to align, select one track as the reference track (usually the closest mic to the source), and click on "Align All". The plugin will then analyze the audio signals and apply the necessary adjustments to each track. You can also fine-tune the alignment manually using the delay and polarity controls if needed.
 
Sound Radix Auto-Align V150 has a simple and intuitive user interface that shows you a visual display of the frequency response and phase delay of each track. You can also solo or mute each track to hear how they sound individually or together. You can also bypass or reset the plugin at any time.
