# How to Create a Portable Delphi 2010 IDE
 
Delphi 2010 is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Windows applications using the Object Pascal language. However, installing Delphi 2010 on multiple computers can be tedious and time-consuming. A portable version of Delphi 2010 can be useful for developers who want to use the IDE on different machines without installation or registration.

In this article, we will show you how to create a portable Delphi 2010 IDE using a free program called Delphi 7 Portable. This program can also create a BartPE plugin, which allows you to run Delphi 2010 from a bootable CD or USB drive.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Delphi 2010
 
Before you can create a portable Delphi 2010 IDE, you need to have Delphi 2010 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website of Embarcadero Technologies, the current owner of Delphi. You will need to register and provide some personal information to get a free trial license.
 
After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions to install Delphi 2010 on your computer. You can choose the default options or customize them according to your preferences. The installation may take some time, depending on your system configuration and internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Download and Run Delphi 7 Portable
 
Delphi 7 Portable is a program that can create a portable version of Delphi 7 Personal Edition, which is a free and simplified version of Delphi 7. However, it can also work with other versions of Delphi, including Delphi 2010.
 
You can download Delphi 7 Portable from this link[^1^]. The file size is about 4 MB. After downloading, extract the rar file to a folder of your choice. You will see two files: DelphiPortable.exe and dp\_source.rar. The first one is the main program, and the second one is the source code.
 
Run DelphiPortable.exe as administrator. You will see a window like this:

After the creation process is finished, you will see a message like this:

You can use your portable Delphi 2010 IDE as you would normally use the installed version. You can create, edit, compile, debug, and run Windows applications using Object Pascal. You can also use third-party components and libraries that are compatible with Delphi 2010.
 
To close your portable Delphi 2010 IDE, just click on "File" and then "Exit". The program will delete all temporary files and registry entries that it created during its execution.
 
## Step 4: Create a BartPE Plugin (Optional)
 
If you want to run your portable Delphi 2010 IDE from a bootable CD or USB drive, you can create a BartPE plugin using Delphi
