The story revolves around Leoncio Santos, an eight-year-old boy who attends a public school. He is different from his classmates because he does not like to play with them and prefers to be alone. He also has a dark complexion, a flat nose, and thick lips that make him look older than his age. His teacher, who narrates the story, tries to help him by encouraging other children to befriend him, but Leoncio remains aloof and distant.
 
One day, the teacher discovers that Leoncio has a secret: he works as a shoe-shiner after school to help his mother who is sick and his father who is unemployed. He also reveals that he wants to study hard and become a doctor someday. The teacher is moved by Leoncio's situation and admires his courage and determination. She decides to give him a pair of shoes as a gift, hoping that it will make him happy and more confident.
 
However, the gift backfires when Leoncio's classmates tease him for wearing new shoes that do not match his old clothes. They also accuse him of stealing the shoes from someone else. Leoncio runs away from them, feeling hurt and humiliated. He throws away the shoes and goes back to his old ones. The teacher finds him crying and tries to comfort him. She tells him that she is proud of him and that he should not mind what others say. She also promises to help him achieve his dreams.
 
The story ends with Leoncio smiling and thanking the teacher for her kindness. He also says that he will keep the shoes as a reminder of her generosity. The teacher feels happy and hopeful for Leoncio's future.
