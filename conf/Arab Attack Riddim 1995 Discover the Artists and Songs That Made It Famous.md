The riddim has a distinctive sound that combines a heavy bassline, a catchy keyboard melody, and a snappy snare drum. The riddim is also known for its controversial lyrics that deal with sexual themes and violence. Some of the songs on the riddim were banned from radio play due to their explicit content. For example, Beenie Man's "Slam" was criticized for promoting rape culture, while Spragga Benz's "Things a Gwaan" was accused of inciting violence against homosexuals.
 
Despite the controversy, the Arab Attack Riddim was a huge hit in Jamaica and abroad. It helped to establish Mad House Records as one of the leading dancehall labels in the 1990s. The riddim also influenced many other producers and artists who sampled or remixed it in their own songs.
