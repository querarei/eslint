## Step 1: Create a new project
 
Open WorldMachine Pro 3 Build 3026 Win and create a new project. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your preferences. You will see a blank workspace with a few devices connected by wires. These devices represent the steps of creating your terrain, from generating the base shape to adding details and effects.
 
## Step 2: Generate the base shape
 
The first device in the chain is the Advanced Perlin device, which generates a fractal noise pattern that forms the base shape of your terrain. You can double-click on the device to open its properties and adjust its parameters, such as frequency, octaves, persistence, and lacunarity. You can also change the seed value to get a different random pattern.
 
You can preview the output of any device by clicking on its icon in the workspace. You will see a 2D representation of your terrain in grayscale, where white represents high elevation and black represents low elevation. You can also switch to the 3D view by clicking on the button in the top right corner of the preview window. You can navigate the 3D view by using the mouse and keyboard controls.
 
## Step 3: Add a lake
 
The next device in the chain is the Alpine Lakes device, which lets you create lakes and waterfalls on your terrain. You can double-click on the device to open its properties and adjust its parameters, such as lake level, lake depth, shoreline width, and waterfall height. You can also use the Layout View to manually place lakes on your terrain by using brushes and shapes.
 
The Layout View is a new feature in WorldMachine Pro 3 Build 3026 Win that lets you see your terrain in 3D and edit it with brushes and shapes. You can access it by clicking on the button in the top left corner of the workspace. You will see a 3D representation of your terrain with a grid overlay. You can use the toolbar on the left to select different tools, such as brushes, shapes, masks, guides, and splines. You can also use the tabs on the right to switch between different layers and devices.
 
To add a lake using the Layout View, you need to create a new layer for it. Click on the Add Layer button in the toolbar and choose Lake from the drop-down menu. You will see a new layer named Lake appear in the Layers tab. You can rename it if you want. Then, select the Shape tool from the toolbar and choose Circle from the drop-down menu. You can then click and drag on the grid to draw a circle shape on your terrain. This shape will define where your lake will be located.
 
You can adjust the size and position of your shape by using the handles on its edges. You can also change its properties by using the Shape Properties panel on the right. For example, you can change its elevation, slope, falloff, blend mode, and mask mode. You can also add more shapes to your layer by using different tools or copying and pasting existing shapes.
 
Once you are happy with your shape, you can apply it to your terrain by clicking on the Apply button in the toolbar. You will see your lake appear on your terrain in both 2D and 3D views. You can also preview how it will look with water by clicking on the Water button in the toolbar.
 
## Step 4: Add a river
 
The next device in the chain is the River device, which lets you create rivers and streams on your terrain. You can double-click on
