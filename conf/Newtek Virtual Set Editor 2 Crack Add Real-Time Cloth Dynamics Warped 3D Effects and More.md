One of the main features of Virtual Set Editor 2 is the ability to create holographic virtual sets, which are realistic 3D scenes that can be projected onto a green screen or a reflective surface. Holographic virtual sets allow you to create immersive environments that react to camera movements and lighting changes. You can also add live video sources, graphics, and animations to your holographic virtual sets to create stunning visual effects.
 
Another feature of Virtual Set Editor 2 is the animation store creator, which lets you create custom transitions for your virtual sets. You can use the animation store creator to design animated wipes, zooms, spins, and other effects that can be triggered by a single button on your TriCaster system. You can also add sound effects and alpha channels to your transitions to make them more engaging.
 
Virtual Set Editor 2 also allows you to edit and customize existing virtual sets that come with your TriCaster system or that you download from Newtek's website. You can change the colors, textures, lighting, and camera angles of any virtual set using the intuitive interface of Virtual Set Editor 2. You can also add or remove elements from the virtual set, such as furniture, props, screens, and logos.
