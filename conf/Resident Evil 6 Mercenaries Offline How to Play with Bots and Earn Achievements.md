## Tips and Tricks
 
Here are some tips and tricks to make your experience playing Resident Evil 6 Mercenaries offline with bots more enjoyable:

- If you hear an annoying sound playing repeatedly in the lobby, it's likely because one of the player dials has been given AI status but hasn't got its "Enable Player" box ticked. Just alt-tab out of the game, check dials 2-8, and tick the "Enable Player" box for the dial that's causing the problem.
- You don't need to tick the "Freeze Player" box for bots to work, nor do you have to assign teams to bots as the game does it for you (providing the selected game mode supports teams or AI being on a team together). You can still set teams for each player in 8cf37b1e13
