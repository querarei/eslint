One way to activate Autodesk Inventor CAM 2017 is to use xforce keygen, a software program that can generate serial keys and activation codes for Autodesk products. However, this method is illegal and unethical, as it violates the terms and conditions of Autodesk. It may also expose your computer to malware or viruses. Therefore, we do not recommend using xforce keygen for any purpose.
