Restoration is a complex and multidisciplinary field that deals with the preservation and enhancement of cultural heritage. It involves not only technical and scientific aspects, but also ethical, aesthetic, historical and social ones. Restoration aims to respect the authenticity and integrity of the cultural objects, while also ensuring their accessibility and usability for present and future generations.
 
Giovanni Carbonara was one of the leading figures in the development and dissemination of restoration theory and practice. He was influenced by the Italian school of restoration, especially by Cesare Brandi, who formulated the modern concept of restoration as a critical and historical operation. Carbonara also integrated other perspectives and approaches from different disciplines and contexts, such as architecture, urban planning, sociology and ecology. He advocated for a holistic and participatory vision of restoration, that considers the cultural values and meanings of the heritage, as well as the needs and expectations of the communities.
