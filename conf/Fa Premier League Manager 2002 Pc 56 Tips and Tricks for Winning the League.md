After downloading the installer file, run it and follow the instructions to install VirtualBox on your PC. You may need to restart your PC after the installation.
  
## Step 2: Download and Install Windows XP
  
The next step is to download and install Windows XP on your virtual machine. You will need an ISO file of Windows XP, which is an image file that contains the operating system. You can download an ISO file of Windows XP from [here](https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86).
  
After downloading the ISO file, open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button to create a new virtual machine. Give it a name, such as "Windows XP", and choose "Microsoft Windows" as the type and "Windows XP (32-bit)" as the version. Click on "Next" to continue.
  
On the next screen, you will need to allocate some memory (RAM) for your virtual machine. The recommended amount is 512 MB, but you can increase it if you have enough RAM on your PC. Click on "Next" to continue.
  
On the next screen, you will need to create a virtual hard disk for your virtual machine. This is where you will install Windows XP and your games. Choose "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click on "Create" to continue.
  
On the next screen, choose "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" as the hard disk file type and click on "Next" to continue.
  
On the next screen, choose "Dynamically allocated" as the storage on physical hard disk and click on "Next" to continue.
  
On the next screen, choose the location and size of your virtual hard disk. The default size is 10 GB, but you can increase it if you have enough space on your PC. Click on "Create" to finish creating your virtual machine.
  
## Step 3: Install Windows XP on Your Virtual Machine
  
Now that you have created your virtual machine, you need to install Windows XP on it. To do this, select your virtual machine from the list and click on the "Start" button. This will open a window where you will see a black screen with a message saying "FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted."
  
This means that your virtual machine has no operating system to boot from. To fix this, you need to insert the ISO file of Windows XP that you downloaded earlier into your virtual machine's optical drive. To do this, click on the "Devices" menu at the top of the window and choose "Optical Drives > Choose/Create a Disk Image...". This will open a file browser where you can locate and select your ISO file of Windows XP.
  
After selecting your ISO file, click on "Open". This will insert the ISO file into your virtual machine's
