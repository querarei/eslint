> "If you stretch out your hand against me to kill me, I shall never stretch out my hand against you to kill you: for I fear Allah, Lord of all beings."

Imam Razi comments on this verse by saying that it shows the high moral character of Abel who refused to retaliate against his brother Cain who wanted to kill him. He also says that this verse teaches us to avoid violence and bloodshed and to trust in Allah's justice and mercy.
  
Imam Razi also discusses the reasons why Cain wanted to kill Abel in the first place. He says that there are two opinions among the scholars. One opinion is that Cain was jealous of Abel because his sacrifice was accepted by Allah while his own was rejected. The other opinion is that Cain wanted to marry his twin sister who was more beautiful than Abel's twin sister, but Allah had ordained that each brother should marry the twin sister of the other.
 
Imam Razi then analyzes the arguments of both opinions and concludes that the second opinion is more plausible and supported by evidence. He says that the Quran does not mention anything about the sacrifices of Cain and Abel, but only mentions their dispute over their sisters. He also cites some hadiths and historical reports that confirm this opinion. He also refutes some objections raised by those who favor the first opinion.
 
Imam Razi then moves on to the next verse which reads:

> "Lo! I intend to let you draw upon yourself my sin as well as yours and then you will be one of the owners of the Fire. That is the reward of evil-doers."

Imam Razi explains that this verse shows the cunning and wickedness of Cain who tried to deceive his brother by pretending to repent and asking him to share his sin. He says that this verse also shows the severity of the punishment for murder and injustice in Islam. He says that whoever kills an innocent person unjustly will bear the burden of his own sin as well as the sin of the victim who was deprived of his life and his good deeds.
