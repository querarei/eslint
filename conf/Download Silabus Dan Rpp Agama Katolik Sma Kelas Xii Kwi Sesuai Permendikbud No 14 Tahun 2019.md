## How does a Betfair calculator work?
 
A Betfair calculator works by using mathematical formulas to calculate the expected value of each bet and the overall profit or loss. Depending on the type of bet you are placing, the formulas may vary. Here are some examples of how a Betfair calculator works for different types of bets:
 
- **Trading:** Trading is when you place two opposite bets on the same event at different prices to lock in a profit regardless of the outcome. For example, you may back a team to win at 2.0 and then lay them at 1.8. A Betfair calculator can show you how much to stake on each bet to achieve an equal profit or loss in both scenarios.
- **Arbing:** Arbing is when you exploit price differences between different markets or exchanges to place two opposite bets that guarantee a profit no matter what happens. For example, you may back a team to win at 2.0 on one exchange and lay them at 1.9 on another exchange. A Betfair calculator can show you how much to stake on each bet to achieve the maximum possible profit.
- **Dutching:** Dutching is when you back multiple outcomes in the same event to ensure a profit if any of them wins. For example, you may back three horses in a race to win at 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. A Betfair calculator can show you how much to stake on each bet to achieve an equal profit or loss in all scenarios.
- **Hedging:** Hedging is when you place an additional bet to reduce your risk or lock in a profit after placing an initial bet. For example, you may back a team to win at 2.0 and then lay them at 1.5 after they score a goal. A Betfair calculator can show you how much to stake on each bet to achieve a desired profit or loss.
- **Parlaying:** Parlaying is when you combine multiple bets into one bet to increase your potential payout. For example, you may back four teams to win in a parlay at 10.0. A Betfair calculator can show you how much to stake on each bet and the total return if all of them win.
