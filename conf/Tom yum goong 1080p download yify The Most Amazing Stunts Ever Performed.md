## The Review of Tom Yum Goong
 
Tom Yum Goong is not only a delicious Thai dish, but also a thrilling movie that showcases the incredible martial arts skills of Tony Jaa. The movie is a sequel to Ong-Bak, which introduced Jaa as a new star in the action genre. In Tom Yum Goong, Jaa plays Kham, a young man who loves his elephants like family. When his elephants are kidnapped by a ruthless crime lord in Australia, he embarks on a mission to rescue them and bring them back to Thailand.
 
The movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning cinematography, exotic locations, and a pulsating soundtrack. The action scenes are jaw-dropping, as Jaa performs amazing stunts and fights without any wires or CGI. He uses his fists, feet, elbows, knees, and even his head to take down his enemies. He also incorporates various weapons and objects into his fights, such as knives, swords, tables, chairs, and even an elephant tusk.
 
The movie is not without its flaws, however. The plot is thin and clichÃ©d, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, and the dialogue is cheesy and poorly dubbed. The movie also suffers from some editing issues, as some scenes are cut or shortened for the international release. The movie also contains some graphic violence and sexual content that may not be suitable for younger or sensitive viewers.
 
Despite these shortcomings, Tom Yum Goong is still an entertaining and exhilarating movie that will satisfy any action fan. Tony Jaa is a force of nature who deserves more recognition and respect in the film industry. He proves that he is not only a master of Muay Thai, but also a versatile and charismatic actor who can carry a movie on his own. Tom Yum Goong is a must-see for anyone who loves martial arts movies.
