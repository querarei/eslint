# What is EES Software and How to Use It for Engineering Problems?
 
EES Software, or Engineering Equation Solver, is a powerful tool that can help engineers solve complex systems of equations, perform various analyses, and generate high-quality plots and reports. EES Software can handle thousands of non-linear algebraic and differential equations, as well as integrals, optimization, uncertainty, regression, unit conversion, and more. EES Software also has a built-in database of thermodynamic and transport properties for hundreds of fluids, which makes it ideal for solving thermodynamics and heat transfer problems.

In this article, we will give you an overview of EES Software features, benefits, and applications. We will also show you how to get started with EES Software and where to find more resources and tutorials.
  
## EES Software Features
 
EES Software has many features that make it a versatile and user-friendly program for engineering calculations. Some of the main features are:
 
- **Equation solving:** EES Software can solve systems of equations in any order, with any number of unknowns. You can enter equations using natural notation, with symbols for variables and functions. EES Software will automatically check the units and dimensions of your equations and suggest appropriate units if needed. You can also specify initial guesses, variable limits, and stop criteria for the solution process.
- **Thermodynamic and transport functions:** EES Software has a comprehensive library of functions that provide thermodynamic and transport properties for hundreds of fluids, including pure substances, mixtures, refrigerants, air, water, steam, combustion products, and more. You can access these functions by simply entering the fluid name and the desired state variables (such as temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy, etc.). EES Software will interpolate the properties from its database and return the values in your preferred units.
- **Parametric studies:** EES Software allows you to perform parametric studies by creating tables that vary one or more variables over a specified range. You can then view the results in tabular or graphical form, or export them to other applications. Parametric tables can also be used to generate plots of various types, such as 2-D, 3-D, contour, T-s, P-h, P-T, etc.
- **Optimization:** EES Software can help you find the optimal values of one or more variables that minimize or maximize a specified objective function. You can use either single or multi-variable optimization methods, with or without constraints. EES Software will display the optimal values and the corresponding objective function value.
- **Uncertainty analysis:** EES Software can help you quantify the uncertainty in your calculations by performing a sensitivity analysis or a Monte Carlo simulation. You can specify the uncertainty in your input variables (such as measurement errors or standard deviations) and EES Software will propagate the uncertainty to your output variables (such as calculated properties or performance indicators). You can then view the results as histograms, confidence intervals, or error bars.
- **Regression:** EES Software can help you fit your data to a mathematical model by performing a linear or non-linear regression analysis. You can enter your data as x-y pairs or as lookup tables. EES Software will find the best-fit parameters for your model and display the correlation coefficient and other statistics.
- **String manipulation:** EES Software can handle string variables and functions that allow you to manipulate text data. For example, you can concatenate strings, extract substrings, convert strings to numbers or vice versa, format strings with decimal places or scientific notation, etc.
- **User-defined functions and procedures:** EES Software allows you to create your own functions and procedures that can be used in your equations or called from other programs. Functions are subroutines that return a single value,
while procedures are subroutines that return multiple values. You can save your functions and procedures in libraries that can be shared with other users.
- **Output formatting:** EES Software allows you to customize the appearance of your output by using LaTeX commands or HTML tags. You can also export your output as PDF files or print them directly from EES Software. Additionally,
you can create interactive web pages that allow users to enter input data and view output 8cf37b1e13
