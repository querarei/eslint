Avid First AIR Instrument Xpand2 is a multitimbral workstation that offers four active sound slots, or parts, per patch. Each part can have its own MIDI channel, note range, mix, arpeggiation, modulation, and effects settings. You can combine the four parts to create one amazing patch, or use them separately for different layers or instruments.
 
The plug-in comes with thousands of ready-to-play patches that cover a variety of genres and styles. You can browse the patches by category, such as Synth Pads, Percussion, Guitars, Strings, and more. You can also tweak the patches using six smart knobs that change function depending on the selected part. For example, you can adjust the filter cutoff, resonance, envelope, and LFO settings for a synth part, or the volume, pan, reverb, and delay settings for a drum part.
 
One of the most impressive features of Avid First AIR Instrument Xpand2 is its advanced arpeggiation. Each part has its own arpeggiator that can create complex rhythmic patterns and melodies. You can set the rate, mode, octave range, and latch switch for each arpeggiator. Some patches, such as Action Pads and Loops, automatically activate the arpeggiator as part of their sound design.
 
Avid First AIR Instrument Xpand2 is compatible with Windows 64-bit systems and supports AAX format. You can use it with any DAW that supports AAX plug-ins, such as Pro Tools, Cubase, Logic Pro X, and more.
