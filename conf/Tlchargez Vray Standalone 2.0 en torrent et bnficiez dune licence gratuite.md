One of the advantages of V-Ray Standalone 2.0 is that it can render scenes that are stored in the .vrscene file format. This is a universal format that can be exported from any 3D application that supports V-Ray. You can also create and edit .vrscene files using a text editor or a dedicated tool like V-Ray Scene Editor.
 
The .vrscene file format is designed to store all the information needed to render a scene, including geometry, materials, lights, cameras, render settings, and more. It also supports instancing, referencing, and compression, which can help you optimize your scenes and reduce the file size.
 
Another advantage of V-Ray Standalone 2.0 is that it can leverage both CPU and GPU rendering modes. You can choose the mode that suits your hardware and your project best, or use both modes together for faster results. You can also use V-Ray Standalone 2.0 to render on multiple machines using V-Ray Distributed Rendering.
 
V-Ray Standalone 2.0 is compatible with V-Ray 2.0 for 3ds Max, Maya, Softimage, SketchUp, Rhino, and Cinema 4D. You can use it to render scenes that were created or modified in these applications, or use it as a standalone renderer for your own projects.
